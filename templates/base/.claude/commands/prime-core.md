# Prime Core

Read and understand the core project files to get context about the project.

## What to Read

Read these files in order:
1. `CLAUDE.md` - Project guidelines and conventions
2. `README.md` - Project overview and setup instructions
3. `PLANNING.md` - Architecture and design decisions (if exists)
4. `TASK.md` - Current tasks and priorities (if exists)

## After Reading

Provide a brief summary of:
- What this project does
- Key technologies used
- Current architecture approach
- Any active tasks or priorities

This helps ensure you have the full context before starting work.
